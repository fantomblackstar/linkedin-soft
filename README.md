# LinkedIn Connections Script

### Why Connections Matter
Connections on LinkedIn are incredibly important. The more connections you have, the more opportunities you unlock to meet interesting people, expand your professional network, and discover valuable opportunities. Building a larger network helps you to get more offers and gain access to professionals in your industry.

However, LinkedIn enforces a limit of **100 connection invitations per week**, so use this script wisely and strategically to connect with the people who matter most to you.
